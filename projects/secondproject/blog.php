                <h1>Steps Towards Developing A Content Strategy</h1>
                <p>At its core, your content marketing strategy is your “why.” Why you are creating content, who you are helping, and how you will help them in a way no one else can. Organizations typically use content marketing to build an audience and to achieve at least one of these profitable results: increased revenue, lower costs, or better customers. On the other hand, content strategy delves deeper into (in Kristina Halvorson’s words) the “creation, publication, and governance of useful, usable content.” Note that content strategy often goes beyond the scope of a content marketing strategy, as it helps businesses manage all of the content they have.</p>

                <h1>Looking for Developers? Try This Geeky Community</h1>
                <p>“The only ways for developers to connect with companies were through recruiters and résumés,” Mark told Adam. “I wanted to create a place where developers could share their accomplishments, their ideas and everything they did that is critical for hiring.” By connecting to Terra using a Facebook, Twitter or email account, developers can create profiles that include information about themselves, such as their interests, knowledge, areas of expertise, what technology they use, etc. They can also create “achievement cards” with short descriptions of their accomplishments."</p>

                <h1>How to Spend Less Than an Hour a Day on Email Marketing </h1>
                <p>E-mail marketing can be massively valuable for your business. As more and more marketers lose sleep sweating on Facebook’s next steps towards reducing organic reach to absolute zero, smart businesses are learning that there’s significant and present opportunities in the ‘rented land’ of your social media properties. Hosting discussions on your owned assets, building direct connections between your brand and your audience is often a safer and more binding arrangement.</p>
