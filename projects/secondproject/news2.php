                <h1>Looking for Developers? Try This Geeky Community</h1>
                <p>“The only ways for developers to connect with companies were through recruiters and résumés,” Mark told Adam. “I wanted to create a place where developers could share their accomplishments, their ideas and everything they did that is critical for hiring.” By connecting to Terra using a Facebook, Twitter or email account, developers can create profiles that include information about themselves, such as their interests, knowledge, areas of expertise, what technology they use, etc. They can also create “achievement cards” with short descriptions of their accomplishments."</p>
                <p>Based on their interests, developers can choose from nearly 3,000 communities to join — popular communities include JavaScript, WordPress, HTML, Photoshop, iOS, CSS and Twitter. Users can connect with other developers in the communities by posting public messages, and sharing resources, links, tips and events related to the community. They can also “regeek” (similar to retweet) or “high five” posts that they like. They can also share their activities to their Facebook and Twitter accounts. They can also post Github code on Facebook, or regeek and high five other Geeklist posts. Geeklist has raised $800,000 in funding, and now has approximately 40,000 members. Some of its top geeks are Larry Sanger, who had the idea for and named Wikipedia; Jos Uijterwaal, who made the business plan for Cloud9 IDE, and Robert Kowalski, who created his first computer program when he was 13.</p>
                <p>This is a really profound question that deserved an answer. Since I only have so many keystrokes left in my life, I am blogging my thoughts and emailing a link. I've felt the same way sometimes when playing a video game. It'll get hard as I progress through the levels, but not crushingly hard. Each level I squeak by I'll find myself asking, "did I deserve to pass that level? I'm not sure I could do it again." You get that feeling like you're in over your head, but just a bit. Just enough that you can feel the water getting into your nose but you're not drowning yet. First, remember you are not alone. I think that we grow when we are outside our comfort zone. If it's not breaking you down, it's not building you up. Second, anything that you want to be good at is worth practicing. Do Code Katas. Do a Project Euler problem every few weeks, if not weekly. Third, try programming for a day without Googling. Then two days, maybe a week. See how it feels. Remember that there was a time we programmed without copying our work. Fourth, think about the problem, deeply. Read about algorithms, read Programming Pearls, read about Design Patterns. Rather than copying code from Stack Overflow, copy patterns from the greats. Fifth, get involved. Go to User Groups, Nerd Dinners, meet with others who feel the same way you do about technology. Stretch.</p>
                <p>It's like woodworking. You can START by growing a tree, then chopping it down and finishing it, sanding it, before you make a table. Or you can go to Ikea. More likely you'll try something in between. Modifying a WordPress theme is going to Ikea. Writing you own web framework is growing a tree first because you don't like the existing trees. You have to decide where on the spectrum you want to be, from being a custom furniture maker from the Woodright's Shop or someone who assembles prefabricated pieces made by someone else.</p>
