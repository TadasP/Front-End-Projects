            Terra Pages is a static site hosting service. Terra Pages is designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages directly from a Terra repository. To learn more about the different types of Terra Pages sites, see "User, organization, and project pages." You can create and publish Terra Pages online using the Jekyll Theme Chooser. If you prefer to work locally, you can use Terra Desktop or the command line. Terra Pages is a static site hosting service and doesn't support server-side code such as, PHP, Ruby, or Python.
        </p>
        <p>Terra Pages sites are subject to the following usage limits: Terra Pages source repositories have a recommended limit of 1GB . Published Terra Pages sites may be no larger than 1 GB. Terra Pages sites have a soft bandwidth limit of 100GB per month. Terra Pages sites have a soft limit of 10 builds per hour. If your site exceeds these usage quotas, we may not be able to serve your site, or you may receive a polite email from Terra Support suggesting strategies for reducing your site's impact on our servers, including putting a third-party content distribution network (CDN) in front of your site, making use of other Terra features, such as releases, or moving to a different hosting service that might better fit your needs.</p>
